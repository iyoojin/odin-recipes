        The meat cooked in seconds, and she’d serve these with red leaf lettuce, rice, and red pepper paste. It was just perfection.

        But with my mom being in Korea and all, she doesn’t really get a chance to make this for me anymore.
        
        So I’ve done my best to “grow up” and whip this up myself. Now to be honest, nothing beats my mom’s cooking but this is a very close second.
        
        The key here is to slice the meat as thin as possible. Throwing the steak in the freezer for 20-30 minutes helps with this process tremendously. That way, the thin cuts of meat can soak up the most epic marinade in just a few hours.

        Once it’s done marinating, the hard part is over. Throw it onto a super hot cast iron skillet or grill pan and that smoky, sweet-savory charred bits of meat will simply put you over the edge.
        
        Serve with rice and maybe a side of kimchi for a full meal. Or red leaf lettuce tacos also work perfectly here.
